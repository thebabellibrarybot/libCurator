When you import a component that uses `react-router-dom` into another app, it won't cause conflicts with the other app's router as long as you properly integrate and manage the routing within each app.

React Router uses a declarative approach, where you define routes and their corresponding components within a specific scope. Each app can have its own top-level router, and the routing defined within the imported component will be scoped to that component.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

In your main app (App.js), you might have a router set up like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

If you import and use your custom component (MyComponent.js) into the main app, it will have its own router and won't interfere with the main app's routing:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from 'my-component';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Main App</h1>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Inside `MyComponent.js`, the routing defined will be isolated to that component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/mycomponent">Component Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/mycomponent/about">Component About</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/mycomponent" component={ComponentHome} />
        <Route path="/mycomponent/about" component={ComponentAbout} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

const ComponentHome = () => {
  return <h1>Component Home Page</h1>;
};

const ComponentAbout = () => {
  return <h1>Component About Page</h1>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By scoping the routing within the component and using unique paths, the main app and the imported component can coexist without conflicts.

Keep in mind that if you need to navigate between the main app and the imported component, you might need to consider how the URLs are structured and ensure they don't clash. You can use different base URLs or nested routes to handle this if necessary.
